# Project Information (Lab 1)

-   Project title: TripCost
-   Project description: TripCost is a calculator capable of providing
    crucial cost information to the user about their car trip. Current
    tools available today offer directions, current gas prices, and
    vehicle information. The goal for this project is to combine these
    online tools together as a single entity to calculate the ultimate
    cost for a user’s trip. Combining the distance of the trip, using
    the vehicle’s government rated MPG, and current gas station prices
    for a given location will enable the user to get a better idea if
    driving is really the best and most cost effective option.

## Framework Activities

- Planning
  1. Determine what requirements should be addressed during the
     iteration.
  2. Decide on the time frame for the iteration.
  3. Divide tasks among team members.
- Design
  1. Determine what classes/objects are needed to meet the
     requirements and how they should interact.
  2. Refine the previous iteration's design to accomodate interaction
     with new classes/objects.
- Coding
  1. Create test cases.
  2. Write code.
- Testing
  1. Test code using test cases.
  2. Revisit the Design and Coding stages to fix any errors. 
- Deployment
  1. Release a working product meeting the requirements for the
     iteration.
