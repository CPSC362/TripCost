# Project Information (Lab 1)

-   Project title: TripCost
-   Project description: TripCost is a calculator capable of providing
    crucial cost information to the user about their car trip. Current
    tools available today offer directions, current gas prices, and
    vehicle information. The goal for this project is to combine these
    online tools together as a single entity to calculate the ultimate
    cost for a user’s trip. Combining the distance of the trip, using
    the vehicle’s government rated MPG, and current gas station prices
    for a given location will enable the user to get a better idea if
    driving is really the best and most cost effective option.
